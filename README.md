# Project 0 — Search (CS50W)

## 📖 Description
This project is part of **CS50’s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript** (Project 0).  
The goal was to design a front-end website that replicates the functionality and appearance of **Google Search**, including standard search, image search, and advanced search pages.

The website is built entirely with **HTML** and **CSS**, focusing on layout, structure, and responsiveness.  
It mimics Google’s user interface and navigation system between different types of searches.
