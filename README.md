# Project 0 — Search (CS50W)

## Description
This project is part of **CS50’s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript** (Project 0).  
The goal was to design a front-end website that replicates the functionality and appearance of **Google Search**, including standard search, image search, and advanced search pages.

The website is built entirely with **HTML** and **CSS**, focusing on layout, structure, and responsiveness.  
It mimics Google’s user interface and navigation system between different types of searches.

## Features
### Main Search Page (`index.html`)
- Displays a search bar and "Google Search" / "I'm Feeling Lucky" buttons.
- Uses a simple and centered layout similar to Google’s home page.
- Links to Image Search and Advanced Search pages.

### Image Search (`images.html`)
- Contains a search form that redirects users to **Google Image Search** results.
- Styled consistently with the main search page.

### Advanced Search (`advanced.html`)
- Provides multiple fields for specific search criteria such as:
  - “all these words”
  - “this exact word or phrase”
  - “any of these words”
  - “none of these words”
- Buttons are styled and aligned similar to Google’s Advanced Search interface.

### CSS Styling (`styles.css`)
- Used **Flexbox** and **CSS Grid** for positioning and alignment.
- Maintains a clean, minimalistic look.
- Includes hover effects and consistent color themes.
